# Word Imposter – Social Game

**Word Imposter** is a party-style social deduction game, inspired by games like *Among Us* and *Spyfall*.  
Each round, all players (crewmates) receive the same secret word — **except one** player who is the **Imposter** and receives no word.

Everyone must give clues about the secret word, while hiding their identity.  
Can the crewmates find the imposter before the imposter figures out the secret word?
